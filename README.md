# 🌽 Corn Disease Detection Web Application

AI-powered web application for detecting diseases in corn leaves using InceptionV3 deep learning model.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Disease Detection**: Upload corn leaf images and get instant predictions
- **5 Disease Classes**: 
  - Common Rust
  - Corn Leaf Blight
  - Gray Leaf Spot
  - Healthy
  - Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with gradient effects
- **Detailed Results**: 
  - Prediction confidence scores
  - Disease information and symptoms
  - Treatment recommendations
  - Probability distribution for all classes

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.15.0
- Streamlit 1.28.0
- Other dependencies (see requirements.txt)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**
```bash
cd /media/panda/Data1/leaf_ditection
```

2. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Make sure your trained model (.h5 file) is in the same directory**
   - The app will automatically look for:
     - `best_inceptionv3_corn_full_training.h5`
     - `inceptionv3_corn_disease_full_training.h5`
     - `lightning_studio_inceptionv3_corn_disease_full_training.h5`

2. **Run the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If not, manually open the URL shown in the terminal

4. **Upload and analyze**
   - Click "Browse files" or drag & drop a corn leaf image
   - Click "Analyze Image" button
   - View the prediction results and disease information
